# My Interactive Customer Churn Analysis Project Using a Mock Dataset
<h2>Description</h2>
This is an exploratory data analysis project where I have a wider range of freedom to examine various data points to make obervations and improve the company. In this memo, I'll be covering every graph and chart displayed in my project and explaining its meaning and/or significance in the context of improving the business (the bank in this case). I'll be using Tableau for this visualization to showcase my range of tools, along with Tableau having more visually-pleasing and clearer visuals. I utilized my business understanding, technical skills, and critical thinking skills for this project.
